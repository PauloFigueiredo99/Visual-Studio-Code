            Throughout the term I came to realise that this topic has a large learning curve, which means that
            at the beggining it was tough to understand the coding behind html. However as weeks went on and
            more practice came through, it became easier to use certain code and tags. One specific thing that 
            has still proven to be a challenge even after having done it a couple of times is building a hamburger 
            icon. Hopefully having done it one more time, if I need to re-use it in the future I will remember.
            Now that i've talked about some of the harder aspects, one of the easier bits of the website for me was 
            making the website mobile user friendly. This is because I knew exactly what I wanted to happen on mobiles 
            due to my plan before starting. This made work alot easier when coding since I already knew what I had to do.
            Using CSS has been one of my strong points in this subject, I managed to pick it up very quickly. Organisation 
            is a very important skill in both HTML and CSS because with the correct organisation, coding with CSS becomes 
            significatly easier if you use the correct tags.

        <h1>Website Design
        </h1>
            <p>
                Before starting to do my website, I had many ideas about how to do it, however I settled on 
                having the navigation bar horizontally and keeping the title separated from the rest of the page.
                The page had to have some colour and I didn't like the aspect of dark colours, hence I went for some 
                lighter abd lively colours with the lightblue and the lightgreen navigation bar. The font being black 
                was the objective of the website, it made it easy to read, however, for the navigation bar, the 
                hover animation made me spend some time thinking what the colour of the hover should be. I made my 
                decision on red because not only does it look nice with the light green, but it has very good contrast 
                with the light blue background.

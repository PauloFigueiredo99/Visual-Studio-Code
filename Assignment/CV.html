Extra-curricular activities
When I am not pursuing academic excellence, my social life revolves around sports and music.
I love all sports, but I am especially very enthusiastic with football, which I have been practicing since
I was 6 years old. With regards to music, I see it as something enjoyable and relaxing that helps me
not only to focus, in the case of classical music, but also to have fun and entertainment, in case of
pop music.

                    <br>This valuable work experience that I managed to get during my A-Levels reassured me of what I
                    really wanted to do in the future, leaving my career options wide open, since I enjoyed all of the
                    areas I was involved with. After this work experience, I applied and entered in Faculty of Medicine
                    University of Porto (FMUP). Here I studied 3 years, however after those 3 years I decided to change my path
                    to computer science and applied to Northampton University, which I am currently attending.

                <h1>Extra-curricular activities</h1>
                <p>When I am not pursuing academic excellence, my social life revolves around sports and music.
                    I love all sports, but I am especially very enthusiastic with football, which I have been practicing since
                    I was 6 years old. With regards to music, I see it as something enjoyable and relaxing that helps me
                    not only to focus, in the case of classical music, but also to have fun and entertainment, in case of
                    pop music.
